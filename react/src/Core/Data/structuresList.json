    "Description": "The Entry Arch stands as a testament to thoughtful design meeting practical needs. A steel frame wrapped in serpentinite stone forms its core, with the stone's natural asbestos lending unexpected durability. The true ingenuity lies in its three-fingered stone walls, which guide visitors while keeping wandering cattle at bay. The builders left subtle signatures in the walls - terracotta impressions of their faces nestled within the stonework. Though their planned ceramic fountain never materialized, the arch remains a quiet guardian of the canyon's entrance, its very stones telling stories of adaptation and purpose.",

Forty years later, students rebuilt it with a brilliant twist: they kept the sculptural beauty but reimagined it as a catenary arch, using gravity itself to hold the structure together.

    "Description": "Take a chain, let it hang naturally, flip that curve upside down - that's the secret behind the Poly Pavilion's sweeping arches. Inspired by engineer Heinz Isler, students turned this simple principle into three 40-foot concrete spans that rise 8 feet into the air. They precast each piece, brought in a crane, and assembled what would become the canyon's most social structure. These days you'll find students stringing hammocks between its arches or gathering underneath to stargaze, proving that sometimes the best architecture is the kind that just lets people be.",
    "Fun Fact": "Perfect for hammocks, this social hub is a bit of a star in the canyon.",

It's part of a larger meditation space, with two companion pieces - a cardinal direction marker and a meditation bench. Even its aging process was planned, with untreated wood meant to weather naturally while native grasses return around it.",

A parabolic arch that uses nothing but compression to stay standing, wrapped in wire mesh and stucco to keep the straw dry. They even left a 'window of truth' to show off the hay inside, though it's been covered up since. Best part? It's probably the only straw bale double-barrel arch anywhere in the world.",

They even added automated systems to monitor everything from water to humidity - pretty wild for the 80s.
